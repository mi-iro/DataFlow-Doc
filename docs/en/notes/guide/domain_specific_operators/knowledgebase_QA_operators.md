# Knowledge Base Construction and QA Operators

## Overview

The Knowledge Base Cleaning Operator is designed for knowledge extraction, organization, and refinement for downstream tasks such as RAG, RARE, and RAFT. It mainly includes: **Knowledge Extractor Operator**, **Corpus Text Splitter Operator**, **Knowledge Cleaner Operator** and **Multi-Hop QA Generation Operator**. These operators can be used to process various raw file formats and crawl web content from specific URLs, organizing this textual knowledge into readable, easy-to-use, and secure RAG knowledge bases.

The operator notation in this document inherits from [Reasoning Operators](https://opendcai.github.io/DataFlow-Doc/zh/guide/Reasoning_operators/).
🚀 Independent Innovation: Core algorithms are originally developed, either filling gaps in existing algorithms or further improving performance to break through current bottlenecks.

✨ Open-Source Premiere: The operator is integrated into mainstream community frameworks for the first time, making it more accessible to developers and promoting open-source sharing.

## Knowledge Base Cleaning Operator

The Knowledge Base Cleaning Operator can perform extraction, organization, and cleaning tasks for multiple heterogeneous text knowledge sources.

## Operator Interface Usage Instructions

Specifically, for operators that require specified storage paths or model invocations, we provide encapsulated **model interfaces** and **storage object interfaces**. You can define an LLM API interface in the following way:

```
from dataflow.llmserving import APILLMServing_request

api_llm_serving = APILLMServing_request(
    api_url="your_api_url",
    model_name="model_name",
    max_workers=5
)
```

You can define a local LLM service interface as follows:

```
from dataflow.llmserving import LocalModelLLMServing

local_llm_serving = LocalModelLLMServing(
    model_name_or_path="/data0/models/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tensor_parallel_size=4,
    model_source="local",
    gpu_memory_utilization=0.6,
)
```

You can predefine a storage interface for operators in the following way:

```
from dataflow.utils.storage import FileStorage

self.storage = FileStorage(
    first_entry_file_name="your_file_path",
    cache_path="./cache",
    file_name_prefix="dataflow_cache_step",
    cache_type="jsonl", # jsonl, json, ...
)
```

For each operator, the following sections will detail its invocation methods and parameter lists.
